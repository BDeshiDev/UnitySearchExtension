Extensions to unity search package for quick navigation in the editor:
1. Jump to any gameobject in scene. Select it in the inspector, focus on it in the scene etc.
2. Fuzzy text search. You no longer have to groan everytime you make a typo in the hierarchy search bar 
3. Full keyboard support.
4. If you use the SelectionHistory package, the samples contain a search provider for it. You can quickly search and jump to any object in the selection history.
 
May add more in the future.
